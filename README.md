## The problem 

#### In the programming language of your choice create a class with a method to return the length and longest words in a sentence. For example, “The cow jumped over the moon.” should return 6 and “jumped”. 
#### Create unit tests to test that method, reworking your code if needed. 
#### Explain any assumptions in comments. 
#### Add a README explaining how to execute your tests. 
#### Share via GitHub
